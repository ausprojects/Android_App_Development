## Web Scrapping 
Web scraping, also known as web harvesting or web data extraction, is the process of using software to extract data from websites.

The process of web scraping involves three main steps:
 1.Mining data: Finding the source of the data and pulling it into an environment where it can be manipulated.
 2.Parsing data: Reading and filtering the data for valuable bits.
 3.Outputting data: Taking the harvested data and applying it to whatever the user wants.

### Web Crawling
Web crawling is the process of using a bot to find and index web pages. Web crawlers, also known as spiders or spiderbots, are often operated by search engines to help users find information on the web.
